# NEC-Calculators

#Built to aid users in electrical design by taking the "busy work" out of simple electrical calculations for conduit sizing,
#wire derating/selection, and voltage drop considerations.
#User interface allows single variables to be modified so that tweaks and changes can be made quickly without any additional work.
